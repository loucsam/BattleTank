Essentially you need to be able to
-need tank models (see the marketplace)
-drive around a landscape
-be limited to the landscape, and not fall through :)
-turn, go forward and backward
-raise and lower turret
-rotate upper section
-shoot and reload
-hit an enemy
-knock out/kill an enemy
-see chains moving, wheels rotating
-explosion effects
-release of smoke to disguise position
-possibly night time headlights
-have realistic sounds including:
--tracks squeaking, wheels turning
--turret firing
--enemy or self being hit
--projectile through air noise, near miss whistle
--projectile hitting ground, or objects
--scream of person
-menu system
-save/load
-kill count
-health gauge
-goal, end game , time limit, hit limit , death etc


Some ideas floating around in my head:
Fuel Tank/Electro Tank/Solar Tank
--Your tank also runs out of energy, and needs the fuel source to be refilled
--Sounds can change according to fuel supply
